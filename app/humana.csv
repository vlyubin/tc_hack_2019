HumanaPharmacy - Blog,https://www.humanapharmacy.com/blog.cmd?article=The-burning-sensation-of-heartburn,,"['      Unfortunately, some people know it all too well: “A burning pain in your chest, just behind your breastbone,” as the Mayo Clinic describes the feeling.1   Is it heartburn? Or acid reflux? Or GERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease, also known as GORD in Great Britain)? But wait, are those all the same thing or different? Or, worse, is that chest pain something scarier, like a heart attack?  First, a general explanation from the Mayo Clinic:2', ' Acid reflux is the physical effect of stomach acid backing up into the esophagus.  Heartburn is the uncomfortable or painful chest symptom acid reflux sometimes causes.  GERD is the condition when acid reflux symptoms occur often and regularly.   Acid reflux   Acid reflux, or gastroesophageal reflux, is caused by stomach acid flowing backward up the esophagus from the stomach to the throat. This can be due to the relaxing or weakening of the lower esophageal sphincter, a band of muscle that normally relaxes to allow food down the esophagus.  ', ' Stomach acid is usually safely handled by the stomach’s lining, but if the band of esophagus muscle relaxes at the wrong time, it can allow that acid back up the wrong way, toward your throat and mouth. Because the esophagus is not equipped to tolerate the acid, that can cause a sour or regurgitated taste at the back of your mouth or sometimes a burning feeling behind your sternum or breastbone.3 ', 'Heartburn    That burning feeling is called “heartburn” because of its location in the center of the chest, but it doesn’t have anything to do with your actual heart. However, people sometimes mistake severe heartburn for a heart attack.   Occasional heartburn is typically nothing to worry about. It can be caused by eating or drinking certain types of food, being overweight or pregnant, or bending over or laying down too soon after a big meal.1 ', 'GERD  However, when acid reflux symptoms like heartburn occur more regularly—for example mild symptoms several times a week or severe symptoms at least once a week—that could be a sign of GERD. Other ongoing symptoms of GERD could include a chronic cough or laryngitis.3  Is my chest pain heartburn or heart attack? Chest pain can be scary, and it’s not always easy to tell if you’re just experiencing heartburn—or something more serious.', ' Below are some general guidelines from Harvard Health Publishing for telling the difference between heartburn and a heart attack.4   If you’re still not sure what your symptoms mean, see a doctor or go to the emergency room—and call 911 if you have trouble breathing.      Heartburn   Heart attack or angina     Burning sensation behind breastbone that may move toward throat   Tightness or stabbing pain that can spread into shoulders, neck and arms', '    Feeling like there’s food in the back of your mouth or a bitter or acidic taste in your throat   Irregular or rapid heartbeat or a cold sweat and clammy skin     Gets worse when you lie down or bend over   Lightheaded, weak, dizzy, shortness of breath     Symptoms may be felt after large or spicy meal   Symptoms may be felt during or after physical exertion or stress       Dealing with acid reflux and GERD   ', 'If you experience acid reflex or heartburn, there are things you can do to help manage it.    Change your habits1,5   Cut down on or avoid foods and drinks that you’ve found aggravate your acid reflux. Those might include things like:   Spicy foods, fatty foods, fried or greasy foods  Mint, tomatoes, onions, garlic, chocolate, citrus (oranges, lemons)   Fizzy (carbonated) drinks, caffeine (coffee, tea, energy drinks), alcohol ', ' Second, you can change how and when you eat and what you do after eating, such as:   Eat smaller meals more often and eat more slowly.  Wait 3 hours after eating before laying down or sleeping (that includes after-lunch naps).  When sleeping, elevate your head about half a foot by raising the head of the bed or using an upper-body foam wedge—don’t add more pillows because that may just put extra pressure on your stomach. ', 'Avoid vigorous exercise for an hour or 2 after eating.   Other things you can do include:    Losing weight as advised by your doctor Stopping smoking Loosening tight clothing, especially around the waist (including belts)  Over-the-counter (OTC) medicines3  There are 3 main types of OTC medicines that can help manage stomach acid and reduce acid reflux’s effects:    Antacids neutralize stomach acid for quick relief but won’t heal a damaged esophagus. (Alka-Seltzer®, Maalox®, Mylanta®  Rolaids®, TUMS®, Pepto Bismol®) ', 'Histamine 2 (H2) receptor antagonists or blockers (H2RAs) reduce stomach acid more slowly but for a longer period (up to 12 hours). (Tagamet HB®, Pepcid-AC®, Zantac®)  Proton pump inhibitors provide stronger and longer acid blocking, which can allow the esophagus to heal. (Prevacid®, Nexium®, Prilosec®)    Surgery3   If lifestyle changes and medicines aren’t effective or viable options, your doctor may suggest a minimally invasive surgery such as: ', ' Fundoplication—tightening the lower esophageal sphincter by wrapping the top of the stomach around it.   Placing a LINX®  device—a ring of small magnetic beads around where the stomach meets the esophagus keeps the opening closed to acid but allows food to pass through.  Talk to your doctor about the best treatment for you. If he or she recommends an OTC medicine, some Humana Medicare plans offer an OTC allowance to help pay for your medicine.

Most of us are aware that we should get a new flu shot every fall, but adults can also get vaccinated for conditions like shingles, hepatitis A and B, pneumonia and meningitis. Plus, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) also suggests a tetanus and diphtheria booster vaccination (Td) every 10 years.1 ', 'Why you may need new vaccinations  There are a number of reasons you or your loved ones may need additional vaccinations now, according to Vaccines.gov:2    Some diseases, like shingles, are most common among adults   Viruses may change over time, so new vaccinations are needed (for example, the flu)   Things like your job, health and international travel might require additional vaccinations   Sometimes new, improved vaccinations become available ', '  Some childhood vaccinations may not be as effective as you get older     How to know which vaccinations you may need and when   This is where it can get a little complicated.   As always, your first and best step is to talk to your doctor. If you can get a copy of your childhood vaccination record, that may help your doctor figure out what vaccinations you may need as an adult. There aren’t always clear guidelines for adult vaccinations. According to the CDC:1 ', '  Some vaccinations are recommended after you turn 60 (for shingles), or 65 (for a pertussis booster and for pneumococcal, which can cause pneumonia and meningitis).   Vaccinations for hepatitis A and B are recommended based on lifestyle, travel habits and health factors.   Human papillomaviruses (HPV) vaccination is usually recommended for people under 26, depending on the person’s sex and sexual activity.', '  Whether you should get a chickenpox (varicella) vaccination depends if you were born between 1980 and 1995 (when a new vaccine was developed) and you’ve never had or been exposed to chickenpox.   Vaccination recommendations may change if you’re pregnant or planning to become pregnant.   Based on your age, sex, vaccination history and current health, your doctor can help you navigate the sometimes confusing recommendations.  ', 'Who needs a new measles shot?   Recent measles outbreaks in the U.S. have some people concerned. Although the majority of new cases occur in people who never had a measles vaccination,3  many adults are worried if and when they were vaccinated against measles as children, or if they may now need a booster immunization.    If you received the standard 2-dose MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) vaccinations after 1968, you should have life-long immunity against measles. If you were born before 1957, doctors believe that childhood exposure to measles likely gave you immunity. However, because the measles vaccine used from 1963 to 1967 is considered less effective and not as long lasting, adults born between 1957 and 1968 should check with their doctor to see if they need a new dose of the MMR vaccine today.3 ', ' People who travel outside the U.S., are college students, or have jobs as teachers or healthcare workers should talk to their doctors to make sure they’ve had the MMR vaccination.1  Flu vaccine We may not always think of a flu shot as a vaccination, but it is, and one you should get every year. Because the flu strain changes each year, the shot you got last year may not protect you this year. Flu season generally starts in October, then peaks in December and February, and ends around May.4 ', 'Talk to your doctor about the vaccinations you need.

You go straight to the pharmacy and the pharmacist tells you that you need to get prior authorization for this new treatment. Um ... what’s prior authorization? If this concept is foreign to you, you’re not alone. Many have not heard this term until they’re faced with getting prior authorization from their insurance company before they can fill a prescription or start a medical procedure. Once you understand what it is and why it’s needed, you’ll see that prior authorization is there to help you manage costs and that the healthcare system is working for you.  ', 'What is prior authorization?   Prior authorization is essentially getting approval from your insurance company for a procedure or a prescription your doctor prescribes. It’s an important step to make sure you’re getting the procedure you need and aren’t prescribed costly medicines when there are alternatives you can try.   When is prior authorization needed?  Prior authorization may be needed for multiple reasons. A few examples include:  ', '  There may be a generic version or lower-cost alternative to the medicine you’re prescribed that you can try first.     The medicine can be dangerous to take with another medicine you’re taking.    The medicine is a controlled substance and more likely to be abused or misused.  2 different doctors may be ordering the same tests, which may not be necessary.1   It’s important to note that you must obtain prior authorization first before filling your prescription or starting your treatment.

Controlling the temperature      Some medicines break down in hot temperatures. For instance, some insulins must be kept cold at all times, and medicines like suppositories, gelatin capsules (gel caps) and inhalers can’t be exposed to hot-weather conditions.  ', ' This is why it’s important not to leave your medicine in the car on a hot day. While traveling, keep medicines packed in a cooler if needed, or a cool, dry place if they don’t require refrigeration. This will help protect the quality and effectiveness of your medicine and ensure it isn’t affected by the temperature of your car or the baggage compartment of a plane.    Always check the medicine label for how to properly store your medicine. Unless it requires refrigeration, you should store medicine at room temperature— between 68 and 77 degrees Fahrenheit—in a dry place away from heat, humidity and light.

Blood pressure measures the force of blood flowing through your blood vessels and pushing against your arteries and blood vessel walls.1  Blood flow is important. Your body needs blood and oxygen to feed your organs and keep them living their best lives. Your organs receive fresh blood when your heart contracts and expands—your heartbeat. Your heartbeat pushes the blood through your arteries and blood vessels. This heartbeat and blood flow creates 2 forces. The first—systolic pressure (top number)—is the force when the blood pumps out of the heart. The second—diastolic pressure (bottom number)—is the force when your heart rests between beats.2 ', 'High blood pressure These 2 forces are measured during blood pressure readings at your doctor’s office. When you get your blood pressure reading, you may be told that it’s “120 over 80.” Any readings under or over that may be considered low or high blood pressure. If you’re over this number, you’re already getting into the high blood pressure range.   Here is a chart referencing blood pressure readings of the 2 forces:3', '  Symptoms  If blood pressure is consistently high, it’s considered hypertension. Hypertension is also known as a “silent killer,” because it often occurs without noticeable symptoms.4   Left untreated, high blood pressure can lead to:5     Stroke Heart attack  Heart failure or disease  Kidney disease  Vision loss  Sexual dysfunction     It is recommended that you know your blood pressure numbers and continue a healthy lifestyle to control what you can, instead of waiting for a sign from your body.6', 'Treatment  You can talk to your doctor about lifestyle factors and medicine that could help lower it.7  Lifestyle factors:    A well-balanced diet  Limited alcohol consumption  Limited salt intake  Exercise  Stress management  A healthy weight  No smoking  Taking medicine as prescribed  Working closely with your doctor      Medicines:  There are medicines you can talk to your doctor about as an option to treat high blood pressure. Your doctor will prescribe the one that’s best for you based on your overall health. Here are the different classes of high blood pressure medicine:8 ', '   Diuretics: they increase urine and lower fluid and sodium in your body. They help lower blood pressure by lowering blood volume. Examples include furosemide (Lasix), hydrochlorothiazide HCTZ (Esidrix, Hydrodiuril, Microzide) and indapamide (Lozol).  Beta blockers: they lower blood pressure by reducing the heart rate and blood volume. Examples include atenolol (Tenormin), metroprolol tartrate (Lopressor) and propranolol (Inderal). ', 'Ace inhibitors: these drugs decrease the production of the hormone angiotensin, which causes blood vessels to narrow and lowers blood pressure. Examples include lisinopil (Prinivil, Zestril) and Ramipril (Altace).  Angiotensin II receptor blockers: these prevent the hormone angiotensin from binding to receptors in the blood vessels that cause them to narrow. Examples include losartan potassium (Cozaar), irbesarten (Avapro) and valsartan (Diovan). ', 'Calcium channel blockers: these block calcium from entering into the smooth muscle tissue, which relaxes blood vessels and reduces the heart rate. These include verapamil hydrocholoride (Calan SR, Isoptin SR) and amlodipine besylate (Norvasc, Lotrel)      Your doctor will prescribe the right medicine for you based on your overall health and other conditions you may have. If you’ve been prescribed one of the drugs that were recently recalled due to an impurity in the active ingredient, talk to your doctor about different options.

Grapefruit juice with common medicines  Grapefruit is a nutrient-rich, healthy food choice, but it may be a food you need to steer clear of when taking certain medicines. Grapefruit juice can cause the drug to be absorbed differently in your body, causing too little or too much of the medicine to enter your bloodstream. More than 50 medicines are affected by grapefruit juice, including those that treat depression, arrhythmia, seizures, high blood pressure and high cholesterol. Here is a partial list:5 ', '   Lipitor® Zocor® Plendil® Valium® Tegretol® Pacerone® Prograf®  5. Calcium with some osteoporosis medicines and antibiotics  Calcium-fortified foods and drinks, such as milk, orange juice and cereals, may decrease the effectiveness of some osteoporosis medicines and antibiotics. The calcium can change how your body absorbs the medicine and its ability to help treat your body. To avoid this interaction, calcium supplements and calcium-fortified foods should be taken at least 1 hour after the medicine.6 ', '6. Avoid taking aspirin on an empty stomach  While aspirin can help reduce pain from inflammation, it also can cause damage to the lining of your stomach. It may be beneficial to take aspirin with food and a full glass of water. Talk with your provider if you feel stomach pain or have a history of ulcers.7  This material is provided for informational use only and should not be construed as medical advice or used in place of consulting a licensed medical professional.

But this is not how medicine works! We need to take medicine exactly the way our doctor has prescribed. If not, we may not get any better and may even get worse.  You may wonder why you need to take more of a certain medicine than a friend of yours. It depends on the dose that your doctor prescribed. Doctors prescribe a specific dose depending on your weight, age, health history, other medications and other factors.1 You do not want to take the same dose if you’re a 100-pound female versus a 240-pound male since drugs are metabolized differently per body type and gender.2 Doses are also specific for children and for older adults. ', 'What’s in a dose?  Let’s define dose. A dose is the specific amount of medicine taken at 1 time. This contrasts with dosage, which is the dose plus its frequency over the duration of the treatment. For example, your dosage may be 2 doses of a 200-mg tablet a day for 30 days—1 dose in the morning and 1 dose at night. This applies to both prescription and over-the-counter medicine.  Some drugs are time released so you’re required to take them at specific times. For example, if you are required to take a time-released medicine once a day, you’ll want to take it at the same time every day. If you don’t, you may end up having too much of the drug in your system, or too little, making it less effective. A time-released drug is distributed in your body slowly and evenly over time so that you don’t have huge spikes of the medicine in your blood.3 ', 'Dosage forms Medicines come in different shapes and forms. These “dosage forms” can be pills, liquids, creams, aerosols or patches.4 They can take on different strengths of a drug, relating to the type of dose—high, medium or low. A low-dose aspirin can come as an 81-mg tablet, while a regular-strength ibuprofen may be 200 or 400 mg and an extra-strength acetaminophen may be 500 mg.  But high and low doses depend on the medicine. What might be high for one drug may be low for another. Be sure to read the prescription label carefully and follow the directions. You can easily overdose if you take more than the recommended amount. ', ' Liquid doses If you take liquid medicine, be sure to measure carefully. A spoon that you eat with is not the same as a tablespoon that’s required for medicine or a mL of liquid. If you use a kitchen spoon instead of a proper tablespoon, you may end up taking more medicine than needed and overdosing or not taking enough. Parents often miscalculate how much medicine to give to their children. When taking or giving liquid medicine, doctors recommend using a medication syringe.5 You measure the exact amount in the syringe and put all of it in your mouth. Ask your pharmacist for medication syringes when taking liquid medicine. ', 'Monitoring the dose Sometimes a dose may change over time. Doctors often start with a low dose and monitor how you feel. If you don’t get any better and you’re not having side effects, you may be put on a higher dose. You may be required to get blood tests from time to time to monitor the effects of a medicine. Some drugs are very toxic to the body, so doctors review how much of the medicine is needed to help you get better without making you sick. Side effects might include an allergic reaction, nausea, headache, difficulty sleeping and constipation, among others.6 If side effects are the reason you stop taking your medicine, talk to your doctor first to see if there are alternatives. ', 'Completing the full treatment You may be tempted to stop taking your medicine once you feel better. But don’t give in to this! Just because you feel better does not mean you’re cured. Take antibiotics as an example. If you stop taking antibiotics before your treatment ends, you may still have lingering bacteria in your system that can multiply. These bacteria may have some resistance to the antibiotic you’re taking and if you stop treatment early, they can multiply and grow and form a new kind of bacteria that is resistant to certain antibiotics, such as the methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) bacteria.7 These are known as superbugs and they are a growing problem.8 Always talk to your doctor before stopping any treatment. ', 'Staying on track   If forgetting to take your medicine is a reason you skip doses, then use these strategies to help you remember:   Put medicine where you’re likely to see it—on your nightstand or kitchen table (be mindful if you have children or pets so that it is out of their reach) Post reminder notes on your refrigerator or in an area you frequent most Set reminders on your phone or alarm clock that go off when it’s time to take your medicine', 'Use health apps that let you track your progress and send reminders to yourself  Humana Pharmacy® is teaming up with CareZone to help you remember to take your medicine and track your health information.

Verifying shipping address: We want to make sure we send your prescription to the right address, but sometimes we have more than 1 address on file. When this happens, we need you to verify the correct shipping address before we can proceed.', 'Need authorization: Some medicines require additional approvals from your insurance, such as Humana, to ensure they are covered under your prescription drug plan. This is called “prior authorization” and may cause some delays while we await approval. Unable to contact doctor: If we need more information about your prescription, we make multiple attempts to contact your doctor. But if we’re unsuccessful, delays may occur. When this happens, we may ask you to contact your doctor directly to proceed with your order.', 'Medicine is not covered: If the medicine is not covered under your prescription drug plan, we’ll need your approval before we can ship the order, since you would need to pay the full price of the medicine.

HumanaPharmacy - Blog,https://www.humanapharmacy.com/blog.cmd?article=Sleep-apnea-risks,,"['    As we get older, the quality of our sleep tends to suffer. You may find that you’re not able to get the recommended 7–9 hours of sleep a day1 or that your sleep is interrupted. If you’re not able to get a good night’s sleep, talk to your doctor. One reason for poor quality sleep could be sleep apnea. When you have sleep apnea, your breathing stops temporarily and then starts up again while you sleep. This can happen more than 30 times an hour, lowering the quality of your sleep.2 Even if you had the recommended hours of sleep, instead of feeling refreshed, you may wake up with a headache and could be tired and irritable. ', 'Who gets sleep apnea?  Anyone can have sleep apnea, but it is more common among middle-aged and older adults. About 5%–10% of adults have sleep apnea, although many don’t realize it and go undiagnosed. It affects males 2–3 times more than females, and it affects African Americans at a younger age. Other risk factors include being overweight, having a thick neck of more than 17 inches for men or 16 inches for women, having a narrowed airway, drinking excessively and smoking.3 ', 'Symptoms of sleep apnea Talk to your doctor if you have any of these symptoms:   • Sleepiness during the day   • Loud snoring  • Headaches in the morning  • Trouble thinking or concentrating  • Depression   • Irritability   Left untreated, sleep apnea can be a danger to you and those around you. Being sleepy during the day can leave you distracted and unfocused, or your partner may suffer from your grouchy moods and loud snoring.  Sleep apnea can have an impact on your heart and increase your risk for stroke, obesity, diabetes, heart attack, heart failure, irregular heartbeat and high blood pressure.4  ', 'Types of sleep apnea There are several types of sleep apnea, but the most common is obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). OSA occurs when the muscles in the back of your throat relax. When they relax, your airway narrows or closes as you breathe in. This prevents you from getting enough air in and lowers the level of oxygen in your blood. Your brain senses your lack of breath and briefly wakes you from sleep so that you can reopen your airway. You usually don’t remember waking, since the awakening is so brief. The other less common type of sleep apnea is central sleep apnea. This occurs when your brain fails to transmit signals that control your breathing.5  ', 'Treatment One of the most popular treatments for OSA is continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). A CPAP machine is a device with a face mask attached to a small pump. It blows air into your throat, increasing air pressure and preventing the airway from narrowing. The CPAP machine also comes in a nonmask version with tubes that fit over your nose. If used correctly, it can be highly effective.6  Other types of treatment include dental appliances that reposition the lower jaw and tongue, surgery, nasal expiratory positive airway pressure and hypoglossal nerve stimulation.   If you’re uncomfortable using these devices, lifestyle changes may help reduce symptoms of sleep apnea, including losing weight if you’re overweight, avoiding alcohol and quitting smoking. You can also try lying on your side when sleeping, as this may help lessen snoring and breathing problems.7 ', 'Do you have trouble sleeping at night or staying awake during the day?

It’s a great time to learn more about osteoporosis, who can be at risk and how to best prevent and treat it.     Osteoporosis affects approximately 10 million Americans, and 44 million are at risk. It can affect both men and women of all ethnicities.1 Worldwide, 1 in 3 women and 1 in 5 men have osteoporosis.2   The bare bones of it all', 'Bones are made up of living tissue that is constantly breaking down and beingd. Osteoporosis occurs when new bone isn’t generating at the same speed that the old bone is deteriorating. When you’re young, new bone grows faster than old bone that is breaking down, so you have healthy bone mass. As you age, bone growth slows and bones wear down faster. This can cause bone mass to decrease, which contributes to osteoporosis.3', '  Risks  Osteoporosis risk factors range from lifestyle to family history. Here are some risk factors that can contribute to osteoporosis:    Sex – Women are more likely to develop osteoporosis.   Age – As you get older, the rate of bone tissue breaking down increases.    Race – White and Asian women are more likely to get osteoporosis.    Family history – If you have any family members who had osteoporosis, you are more likely to develop it.  ', ' Body size – People with small body frames are more likely to have osteoporosis.    Hormones – Imbalanced hormone levels can weaken bones. A decline in testosterone and estrogen, which occurs as we age, along with an excess of thyroid hormones, can contribute to bone loss.   Drinking and smoking – Alcohol and tobacco use also can affect bone mass.         Prevention and treatment  Medicine While there is no cure, a doctor can prescribe medicine that may help reduce the risk of bone fractures and slow the breakdown of bone tissue. Talk to your doctor about what drugs are available and what may work best for you.4', 'Nutrients    Getting enough calcium and vitamin D is important for bone health.    While it is recommended to get calcium from food sources, if that’s not possible, supplements may help.  Vitamin D is difficult to get from food, but there is fortified milk and orange juice. A major source of vitamin D is sunlight, as well. If you are still lacking in vitamin D, talk with your doctor about the possibility of taking supplements.5', 'Exercise    Sitting all day long or getting little to no physical activity can contribute to weak bone health. To strengthen bones, incorporate exercise into your week. To build muscles and bone health, the Mayo Clinic recommends combining strength training with weights and balance exercises.6   Here are more tips on keeping bones strong.    Bone density test If you think you’re at risk for osteoporosis, you may benefit from getting a bone density test. The test is generally painless and takes about 15 minutes.

As you go through and shed the winter buildup, be mindful if you’re cleaning out your medicine cabinet. There are proper ways to get rid of medicine to help protect you and others. What to do with expired medicine  According to Consumer Reports magazine, manufacturers are required by law to include the expiration date on medication. The expiration date indicates when the potency and safety of the drug can no longer be verified.1  A study by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) found that most medicines are safe to take after the expiration date, but the strength of the drug may decrease over time. There are exceptions however. You should never take tetracycline, liquid medicines such as nitroglycerin, insulin, liquid antibiotics or injectable drugs such as epinephrine, past expiration dates.2 ', 'Proper disposal methods  If you are tossing out old medicine, know what disposal options are out there. Following these tips will help keep everyone in your household safe, including any children or pets:         In-person disposal services: In many cities, designated pharmacies, police departments, chemical recycling facilities and fire stations are safe places to get rid of any unused or expired medications. You can check for a disposal center near you with Dispose My MedsTM location service.', 'Drug My Meds Take Back programs: The Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) organizes National Prescription Drug Take Back Days throughout the year. The goal is to have a safe and convenient way for people to dispose of medications. You can view days and participating locations at DEA National Rx Take Back.

Scratch out any personal information on the label.  Put them inside another secure container that you can’t see through.

What about flushing medicine down the toilet   While the FDA says it is ok to flush dangerous drugs down the toilet, know that some parts of the drug may end up in our water supply and be harmful for the environment. Flushing should really be the last resort and only if it is necessary.3 ', 'Sharps waste and disposal   Special care must be taken to dispose of sharps waste.

That means more sweetness in 2019. The gap in the donut hole is getting closer to closing in 2019 and we can already taste the delicious coverage.  What is a donut hole, if not a delicious baked good? Here’s an image to illustrate.   The above chart reflects the minimum coverage required by Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. Benefits may vary by plan. ', 'Since Medicare Part D rolled out in 2006, many of those with Medicare found themselves falling in a coverage gap, inside the empty space of the “donut hole.” Once people would reach their plan limits, they would be in the donut hole until catastrophic coverage kicked in.1  The donut hole or coverage gap doesn’t apply to those who participate in the Extra Help Medicare program.2  But starting this year, the donut hole will close for brand-name drugs, thanks to the Affordable Care Act (ACA) and the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018. Since the ACA passed in 2010, the donut hole had slowly been decreasing until 2019, when it gets close to closing.3 ', 'How does it work? There are many stages of coverage when you have Medicare. Here are the stages set to occur in 2019: Stage 1: Deductible  The plan’s deductible ends when total preions during this stage.  Stage 2: Initial coverage limit (ICL)  During this payment stage, the plan pays its share of the cost of a member’s drugs and the member (or others on the member’s behalf) pays his or her share.

Sharing more of the costs with drug manufacturers will also allow for less time inside the donut hole.  For generic drugs What is happening: For generic drugs, enrollees pay 37% of the cost, while Medicare pays 63%. However, only the 37% that the enrollee pays will be applied to the out-of-pocket total.6 Once the out-of-pocket total reaches $5,100, individuals are out of the donut hole and catastrophic coverage kicks in.', 'What this means: Only the amount the enrollee pays will go toward getting out of the coverage gap. By 2020, though, it is expected that the cost for enrollees will decrease to 25% for generic drugs.7  Stage 4: Catastrophic coverage The enrollee will pay:    The greater of: 5% Preferred generic drugs (including brand-name drugs treated as generic): $3.40 minimum All other drugs: $8.50 minimum  The plan pays the rest.', 'See how the changes will affect you.

No matter your age, there are lifestyle choices you can make today to lower your risk of developing heart disease. For example, taking statins—doctor-prescribed, cholesterol-reducing medicines—can help prevent heart disease. Know the risk factors for heart disease Half of all Americans have at least 1 of the top 3 risk factors for heart disease, and these factors are increasingly appearing in people at younger ages:1 ', '  High blood pressure High blood cholesterol Smoking   Additional risk factors include physical inactivity, obesity and being overweight and diabetes. Fortunately, there are ways to modify, treat or control these factors. There are also risk factors for heart disease that can’t be changed, such as:    Age—the older you are, the greater your risk  Gender—males are at greater risk than females  Family history or heredity—if others in your family have had heart disease2', '  Because some risk factors can’t be changed, it’s especially important to manage the ones you can. What you need to know about statins    Statins are medicines that work to lower your cholesterol by blocking a substance your body needs to make it3  Some common statins are atorvastatin, simvastatin, rosuvastatin, pravastatin and lovastatin4 Statins can also reduce the existing plaque that has built up in the arteries and help keep the smooth muscle lining of arteries healthy5 ', 'You should talk to your doctor about the possibility of adding a statin to your therapy if you have high cholesterol, diabetes, high blood pressure, cardiovascular conditions or are a smoker  Healthy habits you can start today Making healthy choices and positive changes can sometimes take some effort, but it’s important for keeping your blood pressure, cholesterol and sugar at a normal level.   Eat a healthy diet. Filling your plate with fresh fruits, vegetables and whole grains gives your body the nutrients it needs and helps control cholesterol, blood pressure, weight and diabetes. Other heart-healthy foods include low-fat dairy products, poultry, fish, legumes, nuts and nontropical vegetable oils. Try to limit your intake of sweets, sugary drinks and red meat.6 ', 'Maintain a healthy weight. Your doctor can help you determine your healthy weight by calculating your body mass index.7 You can then work toward this goal with diet and exercise.  Get enough physical activity. It’s recommended that adults get 2 1/2 hours of moderate-intensity exercise per week, such as brisk walking or bicycling. Children and adolescents should try to get 1 hour of physical activity every day.8 ', 'Quit smoking. Smoking cigarettes greatly increases your risk for heart disease. Your doctor may be able to suggest ways to help you quit.  Limit your intake of alcohol. Drinking too much alcohol can raise your blood pressure. It’s recommended that men have no more than 2 drinks per day and women no more than 1 per day.9     This material is provided for informational use only and should not be construed as medical advice or used in place of consulting a licensed medical professional.

When used as directed, acetaminophen is safe and effective. However, there are more than 600 over-the-counter and prescription medicines that contain acetaminophen alone or in combination with other medicines,1 many of which are cold and flu products. This can be a problem, as taking too much acetaminophen can lead to serious liver damage,2 so make sure to read the ingredients on each medicine you’re taking.  For most adults, the maximum dose of acetaminophen is 3,000 mg per 24-hour period, unless instructed and supervised by a health care provider.', 'Ibuprofen Like acetaminophen, medicines containing ibuprofen, such as Advil® and Motrin®, are used to relieve pain and control fever.

However, you shouldn’t take it if you’ve previously had an asthma attack or severe allergic reaction after taking aspirin or another nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID). Common stomach-related side effects include indigestion, heartburn, and bleeding. Take naproxen with food to reduce adverse effects.5', 'Pseudoephedrine/Phenylephrine Medicines containing pseudoephedrine or phenylephrine, such as Sudafed® are used to relieve nasal and sinus congestion. Common side effects of pseudoephedrine and phenylephrine include nervousness, restlessness, and trouble sleeping.6 Pseudoephedrine and phenylephrine may increase your blood pressure and heart rate and it is best to avoid taking either of these if your blood pressure is not controlled. Most pseudoephedrine products are stored behind the pharmacy counter due to strict regulations on this medication.', 'Nasal decongestant spray  Nasal decongestant sprays containing oxymetazoline are used to temporarily relieve stuffy noses. However, using nasal decongestant sprays too often or for too long can actually worsen your symptoms.7 You may also experience discomfort or irritation in the nose, mouth, or throat, or sneezing.8 Antihistamines Medicines containing diphenhydramine (Benadryl®, cetirizine (Zyrtec®), loratadine (Claritin®), and fexofenadine (Allegra®) are used to relieve runny nose, sneezing, and itchy eyes. Antihistamines can cause drowsiness, which helps if you’re having trouble falling asleep.9 The drowsiness caused by diphenhydramine is why it is used in most over-the-counter sleep aid or “PM” products, so make sure to read the ingredients of each medicine you are taking. On the other hand, the drowsiness may also be an unwelcome side effect if you need to stay awake or drive your car. Avoid taking antihistamines if you need to stay . Alcohol can also make this side effect worse.10', 'Of course, the best treatment for a cold or the flu is to avoid getting it. Wash your hands frequently throughout the day, avoid contact with people who are sick, and get your yearly flu shot.

Taking the right amount of medication on schedule is part of your ongoing care. However, there are many common reasons why you might have trouble sticking to your dosing schedule.  Reason #1: Forgetting to take your medication on time. This can be especially hard if you’re taking multiple medications with different dosing schedules.', 'Solutions: Make taking your medication part of your routine. Connect taking your medication to daily activities such as meals or going to bed. For example, you might set your medications near the breakfast table to remind you to take them after your breakfast, or have a note on the refrigerator to set a reminder.1 You can also use your cell phone or clock to set alarms. And, there are apps that can send you reminders when it’s time to take your medication.', 'Reason #2: Not knowing how or when to take your medication. Understanding the instructions included with your prescription is important to make sure you take the correct amount at the right time. Solutions: Carefully read the instructions included with your medication, which should be printed on the prescription label or included in the medication’s packaging. If you’re having trouble understanding the instructions, call your doctor’s office for help.', 'Reason #3: Not believing your medication is effective or still necessary. It’s easy to think you can stop taking your medication if its effects aren’t noticeable or you’re feeling better. Solutions: Always talk with your doctor before you stop taking your medication early. Many medications might not have a noticeable effect when you take them, but are still important to take. If you’re prescribed antibiotics, you should make sure to finish out the prescription, even if you start feeling better. Stopping early could leave germs alive that might become harder to treat.2 ', 'Reason #4: Having trouble managing the medication’s side effects. Some medications can cause unwanted effects that affect your ability or willingness to take them. Solutions: Talk to your doctor if you’re unable to tolerate your medications. There may be an alternative medication, or lower dose, that might lessen the side effects. There could also be lifestyle or dietary changes that can help.3 Reason #5: Having trouble paying for your medication. The cost of medications can be hard to fit into your budget.', 'Solutions: Talk to your doctor about switching to a generic version of your medication. These contain the same active ingredients as name-brand medications, but can cost up to 80% less. 4 You can also see whether you qualify for drug assistance programs in your state.5 Reason #6: Running out of your medication. Forgetting to refill early enough could leave you out of medication when you need it. Solutions: Ordering your medications through a mail-delivery pharmacy, such as Humana Pharmacy®, is a good way to ensure you have your medications on hand. Medications often come in a 90-day supply, and are conveniently shipped to your home. Signing up for text message reminders makes it easy to remember when it’s time to refill.

There are things you can do before, during and after a big holiday meal to make sure you stay on track. Before dinner  Don’t skip breakfast. You might want to save calories for the main event, but think twice. Skipping meals may make it harder to control your blood sugar and make it easier to overeat at dinner.', 'Snack smart. Fill a small plate with the appetizers you like, then walk away from the table to avoid grazing. Vegetables like broccoli, baby carrots, cauliflower and tomatoes are great guilt-free snacks. Stay active. Play a game with your family, take your regular exercise class or go for a brisk walk during the day. Take extra care with your blood sugar. You might want to check your blood sugar more often on days when you expect to attend a party or group meal.', 'Watch the time. Holiday dinners are often held at odd hours of the day, such as in the middle of the afternoon. You may want to have a snack at your normal meal time to make sure your blood sugar doesn’t get too low.  During dinner  Take it slow. You might not feel full, but it takes at least 20 minutes for your brain to figure out when you are.1 Try to maintain a relaxed pace, and give yourself 10 minutes to chat before going back for seconds.', 'Take it easy with starchy foods. Bread and potatoes are holiday favorites but high in carbs. Try picking one of your favorites or smaller portions of a few.2 Choose healthier versions of foods you like. If you’re bringing a dish, try substituting healthier ingredients or cooking methods. For instance, opt for steamed vegetables over ones cooked in butter or oil. Drink responsibly or not at all. If you plan on having an alcoholic drink, have it while you’re eating and drink a glass of water or seltzer between drinks. Alcohol can lower your blood sugar and interact with diabetes medications.3', 'Enjoy yourself. Don’t let your meal plan become a burden. You’ll be more likely to stick to it if you make space for the foods you really like.  After dinner  Pick the right dessert. Choosing pumpkin pie over pecan pie can save you precious calories and sugar. Clear the table. Once everyone’s finished eating, put the leftovers away so you won’t be tempted to snack on them later.  Sleep well. Not getting enough sleep can make it harder to control your blood sugar and make it easier to overeat, especially foods high in fat or sugar.4 Try to get 7 to 8 hours of sleep each night so you’re rested for the next party.', 'Take it easy. Don’t beat yourself up if you eat too much at a party. Just try your best to get back on your meal plan and make time for some extra exercise.

Commonly recommended screenings Annual checkup This is a chance for you and your doctor to talk about your preventive care needs for the coming year. During the visit, your doctor may conduct a general health exam to check your heart rate, blood pressure and other biometrics. Usually your doctor will ask about your family health history and lifestyle, screen for cognitive impairments and discuss your current medications and risk factors. Your doctor may also create an immunization and screening schedule for the next 5–10 years.', 'Osteoporosis bone mineral density test Osteoporosis is a severe weakening of the bones that can cause breaks, fractures and other painful problems. Anyone can develop osteoporosis, but women 65 and older have an increased risk.1 Based on factors like height loss, dropping hormone levels or a recent fracture, your doctor may recommend a bone density test. This test uses X-rays to measure the density of calcium and other important minerals in your bones.2 Depending on the results, your doctor may recommend ways to strengthen your bones or additional tests to find and treat underlying problems.', 'Breast cancer screening Early detection is critical to improving outcomes for patients who develop breast cancer. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommends that women 50 to 74 years of age get a mammogram every 2 years. Women 40 to 49 should ask their doctor if they should start getting regular mammograms.3 Your doctor can also show you how to do breast self-exams to help with the early detection of lumps, swelling and other changes.', 'Most health insurance plans are required to cover regular mammograms for women 40 and older with no out-of-pocket cost. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) also offers free or low-cost mammograms for those who qualify.4  Colon cancer screening If you’re 50 to 75 years old, your doctor may set up a testing schedule for colon cancer. (Screenings are sometimes recommended earlier depending on risk factors.) These screenings look for precancerous polyps so they can be removed before they turn into cancer.5 Many doctors will recommend a yearly fecal occult blood test, a flexible sigmoidoscopy every 5 years and a colonoscopy every 10 years.6', 'Diabetes screening The USPSTF recommends adults 40 to 70 years of age who are overweight or obese get screened every 3 years for abnormal blood glucose and type 2 diabetes.7 For those living with diabetes, several yearly tests and exams are recommended. The A1c blood test measures blood sugar levels for the past 3 months to ensure you’re in a healthy range. Comprehensive eye exams screen for diabetes-related eye disorders such as retinopathy, glaucoma and cataracts.8 Foot exams check for redness, cracks, sores, wounds and nerve damage.9', 'Other exams and tests Depending on your age and risk factors, your doctor may recommend other exams and tests. A cholesterol/lipid screening is recommended every 5 years, though you may need a yearly test if you have cardiovascular problems or diabetes. Eye exams for glaucoma and macular degeneration should be administered every 2 to 4 years until the age of 64 and then every 1 or 2 years after that.

Remember, not all OTC medicines are suitable for people with certain medical conditions. It’s important to talk to your doctor or pharmacist about possible interactions with conditions such as congestive heart failure or diabetes.', 'Know how much acetaminophen you’re taking Acetaminophen is commonly taken to relieve pain and reduce fever. You might recognize acetaminophen as the active ingredient in Tylenol®, but there are actually more than 600 prescription and over-the-counter medicines that contain acetaminophen. This can be a problem, because taking too much acetaminophen can lead to serious liver damage. Doctors recommend never taking 2 medications that contain acetaminophen at the same time, and carefully following dosage instructions. Also, ask your doctor before taking acetaminophen if you drink 3 or more alcoholic drinks per day.2', 'Ask before you take aspirin off-label You might have taken aspirin in the past to relieve a headache or fever. However, a daily dose of aspirin has also been shown to lower the risk of heart attack and stroke in people who have poor blood flow to the brain, or a heart or blood vessel disease.3 Aspirin doesn’t come with directions for this use, so it is important to ask your doctor if it’s right for you.

HumanaPharmacy - Blog,https://www.humanapharmacy.com/blog.cmd?article=Vitamin-safety,,"['  Vitamin safety   Vitamins and supplements can be quite confusing for many seniors. Do they work? Are they safe? What should you take? With so many options available in stores and online, we met with Humana Pharmacy® pharmacist Adam M. Bell, who holds a doctor of pharmacy degree, for a question and answer session about senior vitamin safety.  Adam M. Bell, PharmD, Pharmacist, Humana Pharmacy clinical programs, Doctor of Pharmacy: University of Pittsburgh (2005)', '  Q: If I am taking a prescription, is it alright for me to also take over-the-counter vitamins? A: Over-the-counter vitamins can be a great addition to a well-balanced diet. They may not always be appropriate for you and your prescription. Just like with medications, make sure your physician is comfortable with the vitamin before starting it, and that your pharmacist has reviewed for drug interactions. ', '  Q: I read that vitamin C can actually block the absorption of my prescription medicine. Is this true? A: Some medication can be negatively affected by vitamin C, including some cancer medications. That’s why you should always review your supplements with your healthcare provider before starting them, and whenever adding a new medication.     Q: If I eat 3 meals a day, do I need to take vitamins or supplements after the age of 65?', 'A: A well-balanced diet is always the first step to good health. Unfortunately, our body changes over time and we may not absorb some nutrients in the same ways, or our medications may impact our supplement needs. As a result, your physician or pharmacist may recommend a vitamin or supplement to compliment a healthy diet.    Q: My doctor suggested I take vitamin D to maintain bone health, but I have never broken a bone. Do I really need it?', 'A: Remember that vitamins and supplements can be prescribed to help prevent complications. If your physician has identified a vitamin D deficiency, or bone loss, not taking the supplement could increase your risk for a future fracture.   Q: I noticed a senior multivitamin at my local pharmacy. How is this different from a non-senior version? A: Senior multivitamins are designed to meet specific needs often found in the senior population. As we age, we may need more of some things and less of others. Often you’ll see differences in iron, vitamin B-12, and vitamin E content. ', '  Q: Could over-the-counter vitamins or supplements be harmful to me if they are naturally derived? A: Yes, even if naturally derived, an over-the-counter vitamin or supplement has the potential to do harm. That’s why you should always review your over-the-counter products with your healthcare provider.    Q: Is it better to take a multivitamin or to take vitamins individually?  A: Some people experience side effects or harm when taking many supplements in combination. Remember that a lot of foods are already nutrient enriched. Talk to your physician prior to starting a vitamin routine as you may only need to supplement one nutrient, or maybe a larger range like those found in a multivitamin, or possibly none at all. ', '  Q: My doctor suggested I have one nutritional smoothie per day. How will that help me? A: A nutritional smoothie can often help to supplement for the lack of nutrients in your traditional diet. This could be due to a medical condition that affects your appetite, or just your ability to absorb nutrients through your regular meals. Again, a balanced diet is the best solution, but having a smoothie can help your body to continue to work to its peak potential. ', ' If you decide to use smoothies to improve your diet, make sure you find recipes that match your needs. “Green” smoothies made with ingredients like kale and spinach can help if you have difficulty eating enough vegetables, and smoothies made with fruit high in certain vitamins can help you make up for some deficiencies. If you need to gain weight, consider healthy sources of high-quality calories such as plain yogurt or unsweetened nut butters. Use ingredients with lots of sugar like apple juice, orange juice, or honey sparingly. If your smoothie is too sweet, the extra sugar can do more harm than good. ', '  Q: How can I tell which brands are the best when I am shopping for vitamins and supplements? A: Vitamins and supplements do not require approval by the FDA, which can create a lot of confusion. Several independent organizations offer seals of approval which you can look for. These include the U.S. Pharmacopeia, ConsumerLab.com, and NSF International. Ask your pharmacist if you need help selecting a product. ', '  Q: My doctor suggested I add a B-12 supplement to help with my fatigue. Why is this? A: Vitamin B-12 can help us to make healthy blood cells, which carry oxygen to the muscles and organs in our bodies. It’s estimated that up to 15% of individuals may have some kind of B-12 deficiency.   Q: I read that vitamin supplements aren’t effective. Is this true? A: Vitamin supplements may not be approved by the FDA, but a lot of data supports their effectiveness when used appropriately. Not all supplements and not all people are the same, so remember to review them with your healthcare provider to see if they are the right fit for you.

The approved list of drugs is determined by a panel of experts independent of your insurance company. This panel, called a pharmacy and therapeutics (P&T) committee, is made up of doctors, nurses, pharmacists, and other experts.  How drug lists are determined The P&T committee meets every so often to review information such as new Food and Drug Administration (FDA) data, doctor’s recommendations and clinical trial results.', 'While the P&T committee makes decisions about the drugs included on the list, they leave the decisions about cost up to the insurance company. If there are 2 or more drugs that are similarly priced and equally effective to treat a condition, they may both be included in the drug list.1  Changes to the drug list Most prescription drug plans have between 2 and 5 tiers. The lowest tier will usually have the lowest copay or coinsurance, and are likely generic drugs. The highest tiers usually consist of brand name and specialty drugs, which are more expensive.1', ' If you are taking a higher cost/higher tier medicine, check your insurer’s drug list to see if there is a lower-cost generic option available that can help you save money. Talk with your doctor to see if switching to a generic is right for you.  Drug lists are reviewed and updated often, and may change at any time during the year. Reasons for those changes may be a lower cost drug that becomes available, or safety or effectiveness issues about a certain drug that need to be reviewed. Your insurer will usually cover a drug throughout your plan year, and changes usually happen when a new plan year begins.', ' If your medicine is not covered If your prescription medicine is removed from your insurer’s drug list, the first thing you should do is talk with your doctor. They can decide if an alternative on the list will work for you. If not, they can work with your insurance company to see if the removed medicine can be reviewed and covered.

But not getting the recommended 7 to 9 hours for adults can have short and long-term consequences.1  If you’re working toward a healthier lifestyle, getting enough good quality sleep is as important as exercise and a healthy diet.     Short-term issues  Losing as little as 1.5 hours of nighttime sleep for just one night can make you less  the next day by as much as 32%. It also affects your ability to think and process information. Sleepiness more than doubles the risk of work injury. According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, drowsy driving causes at least 100,000 accidents, 71,000 injuries and 1,550 deaths every year.2', '    Long-term issues  Chronic sleep deprivation can have negative effects on your mental and physical well-being.  Effects on mental health:   Difficulty managing stress. Even daily activities such as stopping at the grocery store can seem overwhelming.  Damaged memory. Deep sleep helps your brain cells talk to each other. When they can’t, it can affect memory.  Trouble thinking. It’s hard to stay  and focused.', ' Worse moods. Long-term sleep loss tends to make us less hopeful and less friendly.  Less creativity. Lack of sleep may have an effect on the way we process emotions, which can impair creativity and critical thinking.3   Effects on physical health:  Higher blood pressure. For people who have high blood pressure or are predisposed towards hypertension, even half a night of lost sleep can increase blood pressure.', ' Increased appetite. Sleep loss changes the way your brain handles the pleasure response and can increase your desire to eat. Researchers believe that chronic sleep deprivation may be linked to rising levels of obesity.  A higher risk of heart attacks. Lack of sleep is one of several factors that can increase risk of heart attacks.4     Sleep apnea: A widespread cause of poor sleep  Sleep apnea is a sleep disorder in which breathing stops and starts during sleep. It raises your risk for stroke, obesity, diabetes, heart attack, heart failure, irregular heartbeat, and high blood pressure.5 There are several types of sleep apnea, but the most common is obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Anyone may develop it, but it is most seen in middle-aged and older adults, as well as in people who are overweight.', ' Symptoms may include daytime sleepiness, loud snoring, morning headaches, trouble thinking during the day, and depression or irritability. Your partner may also notice that you stop breathing while you sleep.  OSA occurs when the muscles in the back of your throat relax too much to allow normal breathing. Your airway narrows or closes as you breathe in, which may lower the level of oxygen in your blood. Your brain senses this lack of breathing and briefly wakes you from sleep so that you can reopen your airway. This awakening is usually so brief that you don’t remember it.', ' If you have OSA, treatment may involve a continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) machine. A CPAP machine is a device with a face mask attached to a small pump. The pressure of the air breathed is constant and a little stronger than that of the surrounding air, which is just enough to keep your upper airways open. The CPAP also comes in a non-mask version with tubes that fit over your nose.6   ', 'Are you at risk for sleep apnea?

Statins are widely recommended by medical professionals for those who have at least one risk factor for heart disease and are between ages 40–75 years of age.  We met with Humana Pharmacy® pharmacist Amanda Dawes, who holds a doctor of pharmacy degree, for a question and answer session to discuss how statins work. ', '   My doctor prescribed me a statin. Why? Statins are recommended for people who have high cholesterol, heart disease, had a heart attack or stroke; or have an increased risk for developing heart disease, such as diabetes or other risk factors. Discuss the particular reason you are taking a statin with your doctor.    What are statins? Statins are a class of medications that lower “bad” cholesterol, which is also known as low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol. Some of the most commonly used statins include Lipitor (atorvastatin), Crestor (rosuvastatin calcuim), simvastatin, and pravastatin.', '   What health conditions do statins support? Statins help to treat high cholesterol and high triglycerides. Statins also help prevent heart attacks and stroke.    How long will I be on this medication?    Most people who take a statin will remain on the medication indefinitely.   My doctor mentioned that I might be at risk of heart disease. What is this based on? A variety of different factors increase the risk of heart disease. These include: high blood pressure, high cholesterol, diabetes or prediabetes, smoking, overweight or obese, physically inactive, family history of heart disease, unhealthy diets, and age.', '   If I have the occasional alcoholic beverage, will this be ok if I am taking a statin? Excessive amounts of alcohol while taking a statin can have negative effects on the liver. If you would like to have alcoholic beverages while taking a statin, moderation is important. This is defined as 1 drink or fewer per day for women, and 2 drinks or fewer per day for men.    Are there any side effects to taking statins?', 'In general, statins are well-tolerated medications. More serious, but rare side effects of statins include muscle pain or cramping, high blood sugar, and liver problems. Contact your doctor right away if you experience the following while taking a statin: excessive tiredness, yellowing of the skin or eyes, new or worsening muscle pain or weakness, difficulty passing urine, dark-colored urine or pale stools, rash or itching, severe stomach pain, chest pain, or confusion.', '   Do I need to watch what I eat when taking statins? You can take statins with or without food. Some people may experience upset stomach, diarrhea, or heartburn while taking a statin. If you have these problems, you can try to take your statin with your evening meal. Grapefruit may not be safe with certain statins. Ask your doctor or pharmacist if you can have grapefruit or grapefruit juice with your statin.', '   Are statins ok to take with other medications? Some medications and supplements are not safe to be taken with statins.

Although mild stress can have benefits, such as boosting brainpower and the ability to complete a task,1 some stress can take a toll on your health.2 In order to maintain optimum health, it’s important to be aware of the particular stressors you might encounter during the holidays. This time of year can mean celebrations and gatherings, but also anxiety, overeating, and pushing yourself too hard.', 'Research shows high levels of stress can contribute to depression, obesity, and heart disease.3 The planning and travel frequently involved in holiday traditions might be unavoidable to an extent, but remember—the holidays should be enjoyable! They shouldn’t cause you so much stress they make you ill. Here are some tips to keep in mind when navigating the season, so you can strike a balance between the festivities and taking care of yourself:', ' Don’t overcommit. Often, the holidays include invitations to gatherings, social events, and additional travel commitments.4 This frequently causes stress for many people. Only take on what you can realistically achieve! Walking to a neighbor’s house for dinner might be much more attainable than flying somewhere, and you can visit your loved ones at a less hectic time of the year to make up for it.', ' Relax and be social. Memories of years past can sometimes leave us feeling sad if we don’t think this year will live up to those memories. On top of that, the shortened daylight hours can also have a negative effect. But don’t let these things keep you indoors all winter. A nice way to combat the blues is a change of scenery and a cup of tea with a friend. Even 30 minutes of conversation can make a world of difference during the holidays!', ' Stay positive. It’s easy to think you’re the only one doing all the work during the holidays while others relax and don’t contribute. But negativity is toxic and can quickly ruin relationships and even affect your physical well being. Take some time for yourself to lift your spirits—make sure you get at least one chance every day to decompress and reflect a bit. And remember, don’t try to take on everything on your own! Your friends and family might not want to get in your way, but you can always ask them for help to keep from getting overwhelmed.', ' Eat consciously. The holidays typically bring lots of traditional and indulgent treats, but your health may prevent you from enjoying foods that others can consume without limit. Holiday dinners are filled with pies, cakes, and other baked goods that are full of sugar. But being health conscious doesn’t mean you can’t indulge. Instead of depriving yourself of all dessert, take small bites and really savor the taste. If you have high blood pressure, try seasoning your meals with spices other than salt. You’ll be surprised how flavorful your dishes can be.', ' Caring over buying. If your stress trigger comes from financial concerns, then adjust your giving strategy. Try writing a meaningful letter rather than buying a gift for a friend, or spend time makings with your grandkids instead of buying them presents—the memory will last much longer! If distance is a concern, try using video chatting services to connect with loved ones anywhere. Facebook and Google both offer these tools, and there are many other apps that can suit your geographic or financial situation. There are many ways to show loved ones you care besides buying them expensive gifts.', ' Celebrate the small things. Do you feel like the holidays are too big when it comes to commitments? Why not make this season about celebrating the small things? Have brunch on a Tuesday with a friend—who says brunch is only for Sundays? Is your favorite holiday movie on TV? Snuggle up with your favorite blanket, pet, friend, and some hot cocoa. Some of the best memories are made when we’re doing nothing.', ' Get outside. You don’t have to stay inside just because it’s winter. Being outdoors can do wonders for your body and mind. Staying active is something you should try to do every day during the holidays—it doesn’t have to be strenuous.5 A walk with a neighbor or friend after a big meal or a trip to the park with the family can help burn extra calories. Just make sure to not overdo it and listen to your body if you’ve done too much.', ' If stress is overwhelming and depression starts to set in, talk to your doctor about other options.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), more than 29 million Americans have diabetes. In addition, another 86 million have prediabetes, a condition in which the body’s blood sugar is high, but not enough to turn into full-blown diabetes—yet.1 People with prediabetes usually develop diabetes within 10 years.2 There are two kinds of diabetes:', '   Type 1:The body doesn’t make enough insulin, a hormone that allows the body to absorb, store, and use sugar.    Type 2: The body doesn’t use insulin correctly, which is called insulin resistance.3 Most people with diabetes have type 2, and adults who have it double their risk of dying from heart disease compared to adults without diabetes. Once seen primarily in adults, type 2 diabetes is on the rise in young people due to an increase in obesity.4 ', '    So why can this disease be so deadly if not managed? If blood sugar is not kept in check, it can damage your nerves and blood vessels, leading to heart disease. It also can hurt your kidneys, feet, and vision. The CDC reports that women with diabetes carry a 40% greater risk of developing heart disease, and a 25% greater risk of stroke than men with diabetes.5 The increase in childhood diabetes puts these young people at increased risk for heart disease as well.', '   Change your life, change your risk The good news is that with careful medical intervention and lifestyle changes, the effects of diabetes can be controlled. In fact, type 2 diabetes can even be reversed.  You can lessen diabetes’ impact on the heart by eating a heart-healthy diet. A registered dietitian can help you plan an individually tailored diet. In general, however, follow these rules from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases:', ' Rule 1: For every 1,000 calories you eat, make sure 14 grams of it is fiber—in the form of oats, bran, whole grain breads and cereals, dried beans and peas, and fruits and vegetables. This will help control your cholesterol levels. If you have digestive issues with the sudden fiber increase, cut back and then slowly raise the amount.  Rule 2: Limit saturated fat, which is found in red meats, poultry skin, butter, dairy products with fat, shortening, lard, and certain oils like palm and coconut.', ' Rule 3: Don’t eat more than 300 milligrams of cholesterol daily. Cholesterol is found in meat, dairy products, and eggs.  Rule 4: Stay away from trans fat, which is found in processed foods such as commercially prepared baked goods, microwave popcorn, fried foods, salad dressings, some vegetable shortenings and margarine, and foods that contain partially hydrogenated oil. Always check the Nutrition Facts label for trans fat amounts. You want to avoid this type of fat, since it raises your blood cholesterol and increases your risk of heart disease.6', ' Other lifestyle changes There are other lifestyle changes that may reduce the chance of prediabetes becoming full-blown diabetes, and these changes can help control diabetes if you already have it. Here are some tips:     Follow your healthcare provider’s instructions for taking medications.  Quit smoking, and talk with your doctor about your alcohol consumption.  Lose weight. Central obesity—a waist measurement of more than 40 inches for men and more than 35 inches for women—increases the production of bad cholesterol, which raises the risk of heart disease.7', ' Exercise more. Try for at least 30 minutes daily. If you haven’t been very active, consult with your healthcare provider, who can help set up an appropriate and safe exercise routine.8  Do yoga. The American Diabetes Association has found that a regular yoga practice helps control type 2 diabetes by reducing body weight and increasing blood sugar control.9  This material is provided for informational use only and should not be construed as medical advice or used in place of consulting a licensed medical professional.

But antibiotics don’t always kill bacteria so easily, and bacteria are becoming more and more resistant to antibiotics. This kind of hard-to-kill bacteria is called antibiotic-resistant bacteria. According to the Journal of the American Medical Association, infections from resistant bacteria kill more people in the United States than AIDS. In 2005 alone, more than 94,000 Americans got sick from methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections. Almost 19,000 people died from it. MRSA is a serious bacterial infection that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) says affects mostly patients in hospitals.*', ' Super bugs, as they’re sometimes called, are hard to fight. But there are a few things you can do to help slow the spread of super bugs:       Antibiotics don’t treat common viruses like the cold, flu or other respiratory illness such as acute bronchitis. Antibiotics fight bacterial infections, not viral infections. If they’re used too often, antibiotics don’t work as well against the bacteria they were made to treat.', ' Most coughs and upper respiratory infections are viral. If your doctor says you don’t need antibiotics, be glad—antibiotics can cause an upset stomach and allergic reactions. To make you feel better, ask your doctor for ways to make you more comfortable. Most ear, sinus, and lung infections don’t need antibiotics. For most healthy adults and children who have an infection that isn’t spreading, antibiotics won’t help you feel better any sooner.', 'When you take antibiotics, follow your doctor’s directions. When you start to feel better, it’s easy to forget to finish your antibiotics. But stopping can lead to drug-resistant bacteria. Finish off the infection by finishing your antibiotic. Never take antibiotics without a prescription. And if you have some left over from the last time you were sick, throw them away. They can do more harm than good.', 'Slow the spread of bacteria by washing your hands. The CDC says you should wash your hands:       Before, during, and after preparing food Before eating After using the toilet After changing diapers or cleaning up a child who has used the toilet Before and after caring for someone who is sick After blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing After touching an animal or animal waste After touching garbage', 'Before and after treating a cut or wound  When you do get sick, see a doctor right away. The sooner you’re seen, the sooner you can get treated, and the sooner you can feel better. Antibiotics do their best work within 72 hours of an infection, so timing is important.

Just because you’re on vacation doesn’t mean your health is! Plan ahead and make sure you have enough of your medicine so your travels are stress-free.    Organize your health information  Make a list of all your medicine along with the name of your doctor and pharmacy, and phone numbers. This will come in handy should you need to visit a doctor when on vacation or in emergency situations. If you’re traveling with others, make sure they also have a copy of your medicine list and your doctor’s contact information. If you’re traveling overseas, you can ask your doctor if you can email them instead of calling. Some doctors offer patients access to an online medical portal to submit questions and medicine requests.', '   Request more medicine if needed  You never know if you’ll face delays—or worse, lose your luggage—so it’s smart to pack a bit more medicine than you need when traveling. Call your insurance plan and ask for a “vacation override.” You may receive extra medicine to get through your trip.   For Humana members, call the number on the back of your member ID card.    Research local pharmacies  Locate a few pharmacies near your destination in case something happens to your medicine. The concierge at your hotel can recommend nearby pharmacies. Most pharmacies allow prescription transfers if you have the phone number of your pharmacy with a medicine list. Don’t forget to use pharmacies in your insurance plan’s network to save costs.', '  Search Humana’s list of network pharmacies    Confirm travel requirements  It is always recommended to carry your medicine with you rather than packing it in your luggage. You don’t want to miss a dose if your luggage is lost or delayed!   Due to security, airlines have strict requirements of what can be carried on a flight. Liquids are limited to 3.4 ounces and you may be required to have your preion bottles to avoid confusion with airport security officials.', '  To be sure, call your airline ahead of time and confirm travel requirements. Also call your hotel about an in-room fridge if you’re traveling with injectables or medicine requiring refrigeration. These should be stored in an insulated cooler while traveling.    Adjust to time zones  Knowing when to take your medicine can be a challenge when traveling abroad or crossing time zones. To make sure you take your medicine on time, count the hours from your last dose to determine when to take your next one. You’ll want to space out your medicine in the same intervals you do at home when changing time zones.', '  It may be worthwhile to bring an extra alarm clock or watch that has your home time zone so you know when your next dose is due. After a couple days you can switch to local time to take your medicine since changes in meal schedules and fluid consumption can alter the effects of some medicine.    Set reminders  Setting reminders can help take your medicine on time even while on vacation. You can set an alarm on your phone or use apps that offer reminders, such as Humana’s MyHealth Mobile app for iPhone. Download the MyHealth app now to easily set pill reminders for your medicine.', '                                     Previous                                                  Next           ']"

Osteoporosis is called the ""silent disease"" because many don’t know they have it. It sneaks up without any symptoms until a bump or a fall leads to a broken bone.1 A broken hip is one of the most serious injuries resulting from a fall. Each year, more than 300,000 Americans age 65 and older are hospitalized for hip fractures, and 3 out of 4 of them are women.2 One reason women are much more likely to fracture their hip is because they have a greater risk of developing osteoporosis. Women have thinner bones than men to begin with, and, after menopause, they lose bone mass faster than men.', ' Men aren’t immune to osteoporosis; in fact, more than 2 million in the United States have the disease. Besides gender, other osteoporosis risk factors that are out of your control include being a small, thin-boned woman; being a white or Asian woman; and having a family history of osteoporosis.3  Osteoporosis can also lead to small compression fractures of the vertebrae (the bones of the spine) that might not even cause any pain. Symptoms4 include:', '    Sloping shoulders    Curve in the back    Height loss    Back pain    Hunched posture    Protruding abdomen      But there are steps5 you can take to reduce your chances of developing osteoporosis and suffering a fracture:      Quit smoking. It’s bad for your bones as well as your heart and lungs.   Drink no more than one alcoholic beverage a day. Too much alcohol increases your risk of bone loss and fractures.', '   Get enough calcium in your diet. If you’re a woman over 50, you should get 1,200 milligrams (mg) of calcium a day; and if you’re 50 or younger, you need 1,000 mg of calcium a day. Men should get 1,000 mg a day.     Get enough vitamin D. If you’re under 70, you should get 600 international units (IU) a day. If you’re over 70, aim for 800 IU a day.    Exercise. Weight-bearing exercise strengthens bone as well as muscle. Types of bone-strengthening exercises include dancing, hiking, jogging, or playing tennis.6', '   If you’re a woman 65 or older, or a man 70 or older, you should be screened for osteoporosis with a bone density test.7 If you’re younger than 65 and have risk factors for osteoporosis, you should talk to your doctor about whether you should get a bone density test.

Hepatitis A, B and C—the most common types of viral liver infection in the U.S.—lessen the liver’s ability to do its more than 500 jobs, including filtering blood, digesting food, and storing energy.1  When people are infected with hepatitis A and B, the infection usually clears on its own. Luckily these two types of the disease can be prevented with vaccines, typically given in childhood. But there’s no vaccine to prevent hepatitis C. Up to 3.9 million Americans are infected with hepatitis C, many of whom don’t know they have it.2', ' In the early, acute stage of hepatitis C, patients may experience fever, fatigue, nausea, abdominal pain, or yellowing of the skin and eyes (jaundice). For some people, the infection clears. But about 45-85% of people infected with the virus develop chronic infection, and may go years without symptoms.3      Higher risk for baby boomers 75% of Americans with hepatitis C are in the baby boom generation, born between 1945 and 1965.3 They grew up in an era before doctors knew about the disease. Back then, blood wasn’t screened for the virus, and doctors didn’t use disposable needles. Since there weren’t universal procedures to clean medical equipment, improperly sterilized equipment may have helped transmit the virus. Past intravenous drug use also contributes to the higher rate of disease in this group. ', ' The problem is that hepatitis C can fester for years or even decades, slowly damaging the liver, and in some cases leading to cirrhosis (scarring) of the liver, or liver cancer. Since baby boomers are more likely to be infected with hepatitis C than other groups, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has recommended that these individuals be screened for the virus, even if they don’t have identifiable risk factors, such as having a blood transfusion prior to 1992, or a history of drug use.4 ', '     New treatments, brighter future The good news: The outlook for patients infected with hepatitis C has brightened considerably in the last few years. New medications are revolutionizing the treatment for the hepatitis C, transforming it from a chronic, to a largely curable disease.  Among the new hepatitis C drugs are Harvoni, Sovaldi, and Daklinza. These highly effective medications are much easier to take and can cure hepatitis C in most people. However, they can be expensive. It’s important to find a specialist who has a great deal of experience treating people with hepatitis C to help navigate treatment, including paying for it. The American Liver Foundation offers a downloadable Financial Assistance Resource Support Guide and a free Drug Discount Card that can be used for preion-assistance programs offered by drug companies for specific medications.5', '     How specialty pharmacies can help Specialty pharmacies, like Humana Specialty Pharmacy, often provide additional support for complex conditions, including hepatitis C.

However, this has also resulted in a nationwide epidemic of opioid abuse that has become a top priority for the Department of Health and Human Services. Many people who become addicted to opioids end up switching to the cheaper heroin.* ', '  Here are facts that should get your attention:      91 Americans die every day from opioid abuse—including prescription and heroin use—and that number increases every year.*    Since 1999, deaths involving opioids have quadrupled in the U.S.*    In 2007, of the nearly 28,000 Americans who died from unintentional drug poisoning, nearly 12,000 involved prescription pain relievers.*   Nearly half a million emergency department visits nationwide in 2009 were due to people misusing or abusing prescription painkillers.* ', '  Withdrawal from friends, work, school, and favorite activities   Depression and/or anxiety   Mood swings   Doesn’t seem to care about anything or gets very secretive   Money goes missing   Appears antsy or nervous*      If you or a loved one is already taking opioids, here are some signs to watch out for that may indicate dependency or addiction:   There is another way to go.

Airport security   1. Many people don’t know that medicine can be kept in a carry-on. In fact, this is recommended to avoid issues with theft or loss.   2. Bring a medicine list from your doctor or healthcare professional listing your disease states and the prescriptions you currently take, in case airport security asks. Many physicians will give you a discharge summary after your visit that would serve this purpose. ', ' 3. Keep large liquids in their original prescription bottles. This is important as medically necessary items are allowed to exceed the typical 100ml airline security restriction.   4. While these rules apply to travel in the United States, laws may differ in foreign countries. In order to ensure your medicine can stay with you, it’s important to check if there are any restrictions that might hinder you when you arrive at your destination. Ask your airline about any such restrictions. Your hotel’s concierge might also know. ', '  What to do if your medicine is lost or damaged while traveling  1. Be sure to bring enough medicine for your entire vacation. Even bringing extra doses is recommended.   2. If you do misplace or damage your medicine, having written prescriptions can save a lot of hassle.   3. Pharmacies can transfer preion.   Storing medicine at your hotel, on a cruise ship, etc.   1. Be aware of any storage precautions for your medicine, including exposure to certain temperatures, light, or moisture. Ask your pharmacist how these weather conditions might affect your medicine. For example, people might not know that once opened, certain insulins can be stored at room temperature for a set number of days. ', ' 2. Use the same cautions you would at home. For young children, safety caps can be utilized to prevent unintended ingestion. If you’re staying in a room with a safe, that might be a good place to keep your medicine.    How to stay on track with your medicine when traveling  1. Don’t let your medicine take a backseat during the holiday season. Focus on taking medicine as prescribed in the weeks leading up to your vacation. Establishing good habits can help you stay on track when traveling.', ' 2. Just because you’re on vacation and out of your normal routine, many chronic conditions don’t take a break. Medicine non-adherence contributes to an estimated two-thirds of hospitalizations. Medicine adherence plays a big role in staying healthy and out of the hospital.   3. Use a reminder app like Medisafe to help you take medication on schedule.   4. Remember: the holidays are a time to relax and have fun. But don’t take a break from your medication. Take all doses as prescribed, and on time.

Cholesterol Screening/Lipid Profile – Start screenings at age 20, and every 5 years afterward.    Blood Pressure – Check at least once a year, from childhood onward.', '   Diabetes Screening – Have one every year after age 45; be screened earlier and more often depending on risk factors.

It can also lead to heart failure.1      The American Heart Association (AHA) recommends getting no more than 2,400 milligrams (mg) of sodium a day, but less than 1,500 mg a day may be more ideal for some people.2 Talk to your doctor about the right amount for you.

Because of the high intake of convenience foods, most Americans eat more than 3,400 milligrams daily.2      Check the Nutrition Facts label on the food package, and try to limit ingredients that contain sodium, salt, or soda; which include sodium bicarbonate, baking soda, sodium nitrate, and monosodium glutamate. These are all hidden sources of salt.', ' Sugar shock  Sugar can also wreak havoc on the cardiovascular system, even if you are not overweight. According to a recent study, you have a 38% higher risk of dying from heart disease if you get 17–21% of your calories from added sugars, compared to those who only get 8% of their calories from the same.3       Added sugars are those that do not naturally occur in food, such as in fruit or milk. There are different types of sugar—white sugar, brown sugar, corn sweetener, corn syrup, syrup, honey, fruit-juice concentrate, malt sugar, and molasses—added to such foods as pasta sauce, yogurt, canned fruit and granola.4 So what you believe is healthy may not be that healthy when all those sugars are added. Be sure to check the Nutrition Facts label to see how many grams of sugar is in the food and if any of the ingredients above are at the top of the list of ingredients.5', '     According to the AHA, women should have no more than 6 teaspoons, or 100 calories, of sugar per day, and men should have no more than 9 teaspoons, or 150 calories, of sugar a day.3      A can of regular soda contains about 35 grams of added sugars. There are 4 calories in a gram of sugar. To see how many calories of sugar there are in a can of soda, multiply 4 with 35 to get 140. That’s 140 calories of added sugar per can—more than the recommended daily amount for women! Avoiding sugary sodas can go a long way in protecting your heart. Too much sugar can harden the arteries and stress the heart.6', '        DASH diet    A good way to reduce salt and sugar intake—and improve heart health by lowering blood pressure and bad cholesterol—is to follow the DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) diet.7 This diet was ranked as the overall best by the U.S. News and World Report.8 Check first with your doctor before starting a new diet.

Seasonal affective disorder (SAD) is a type of depression that comes and goes according to the seasons.   What are the symptoms of seasonal affective disorder?  Symptoms typically appear during late fall or early winter, but some people can have symptoms that begin in the spring or summer. Symptoms may start out mild and become more severe as the season progresses.', '  Symptoms specific to winter-onset SAD, sometimes called winter depression, can include:       Bad mood  Fatigue or low energy Problems getting along with other people Heavy, ""lead-like"" feeling in the arms or legs Oversleeping, or trouble sleeping Appetite changes, especially a craving for foods high in carbohydrates Weight gain        Symptoms specific to summer-onset seasonal affective disorder, sometimes called summer depression, may include:*', '    Depression  Oversleeping, or trouble sleeping Weight loss Poor appetite Agitation or anxiety         Strategies to ease SAD symptoms  The good news is there are ways to beat the winter blues and improve your mood. Combat seasonal sadness by trying some of these strategies:  Brighten up your room. During winter months when the sun goes down earlier, your body may crave more daylight. Try sitting or laying next to an artificial light box for up to 10-15 minutes per day to start and increasing the time based on how you feel. The box gives off bright light that mimics natural outdoor light.** During the day, you can also get exposure to more natural sunlight by opening blinds and curtains and sitting closer to windows.  ', 'Exercise. A Harvard University study says that walking at a fast pace for about 35 minutes a day five times a week, or 60 minutes a day three times a week, can reduce depression. If it’s not too cold out, try walking outside in natural light during the day to further reduce SAD symptoms.   Turn on the tunes. As we mentioned in our healthy New Year’s resolutions blog, listening to feel-good music can improve your mood. Online music services such as Pandora or Spotify offer upbeat playlists.  ', 'Eat well. While your body might crave carbohydrates and sugar in the winter, be careful of the source. Research shows that candy, sweets and pastries can provide temporary euphoric feelings but can ultimately increase depression. Healthy sources of natural carbohydrates, like sweet potatoes, winter squash and fruit, on the other hand, can be great antidotes to your sweet tooth.  Travel. Use your vacation time in the winter to visit a sunny destination. Even the act of travel planning can improve your mental health by giving you something to look forward to.  ', 'Volunteer. Not only can helping someone else boost your mood, but it is also good for your health, according to a Carnegie Mellon University study.

HumanaPharmacy - Blog,https://www.humanapharmacy.com/blog.cmd?article=Is-generic-medicine-right-for-you,,"['      Do you trust only known brands to treat your health? If so, there may be a few things you should consider. When it comes to your medicine, a generic version may be just as effective at treating your condition as a brand-name version. According to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), generic versions of medicine offer the same quality and performance as brand name but cost on average 80-85% less. No wonder the majority of medicine being filled today is generic!1', '  While you may be enticed to choose a brand-name medicine over a generic version, you may reconsider once you look at some of the benefits of switching to generic.   Same active ingredients    Generic medicine has the same active ingredients as a brand name and is identical in dosage, strength and safety. The only difference is the inactive ingredients, such as flavoring or preservatives. This is why generics look different from brand names. It’s just the outside packaging that’s different; not the ingredients inside that work to treat your condition. ', '  Before a generic medicine can be sold, the generic manufacturer must prove to the FDA that the generic is the same, or bioequivalent, as the brand-name medicine. This requires passing rigorous tests and inspections from the FDA to ensure the generic version is the same high quality as the brand name. So statements that generic medicine is made in subpar facilities are simply not correct. In fact, many generics are produced in the same facilities as brand names.', ' Expensive does not mean better   So you ask, “How can the generic be that much cheaper?” There’s a good reason for this. When developing a new medicine, there’s a lot of costs that go into research and development—on average about 2 billion dollars. Not only are there research and development costs, brand-name manufacturers must also pay for clinical trials to make sure the medicine is safe and effective to use on patients. Because of all this upfront investment, the FDA gives the original manufacturer a few years of exclusive rights when the medicine is first out in the market. This means the original manufacturer is the only one who can sell the new medicine, which sometimes translates to very high costs. ', '  Fortunately, once the exclusivity is over, generic manufacturers are able to create the same medicine for less. Unlike brand-name manufacturers, generic manufacturers don’t need to spend money on research and development—not to mention marketing—because that was all done for them. They basically take the recipe the brand-name manufacturer has developed and use that to create their own generic version. ', ' A potential for huge savings     In most cases, this adds up to huge savings for patients without sacrificing quality. According to the Generic Pharmaceutical Association (GPhA), generic medicine saves Americans billions of dollars each year.2 Nearly 90% of prescriptions filled are now generic, from treating back pain to lowering cholesterol.    By switching to generic, most patients can reduce their prescription costs by about half. Here are some examples of how much you could save per day by switching to generic.
