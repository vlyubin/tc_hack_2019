        <p id="paragraph">Relevant paragraph: It\\'s not known exactly what causes atypical depression or why some people have different features of depression. Atypical depression often starts in the teenage years, earlier than other types of depression, and can have a more long-term (chronic) course.

Neurotransmitters are naturally occurring brain chemicals that carry signals to other parts of your brain and body.
